# Data Synchronization Summary

## âœ… Order and Payment Data Alignment

### Problem Identified
The order data in `business-app` and payment data in `payment-app` were mismatched:

**Before:**
- **Orders**: IDs 100, 102, 103, 104 with customers like "John Doe", "Alicia Date", etc.
- **Payments**: IDs 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004 with different customers like "Jane Smith", "Alice Johnson", etc.

### Solution Applied
Updated payment data to match order data for proper integration.

**After:**
- **Orders** (business-app): IDs 100, 102, 103, 104
- **Payments** (payment-app): Now reference the same order IDs (100, 102, 103, 104)

## ðŸ“Š Data Mapping

| Order ID | Customer Name | Order Status | Order Amount | Payment Status | Payment Amount | Order Date |
|----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|----------------|------------|
| 100 | John Doe | PENDING | â‚¬100.00 | COMPLETED | â‚¬100.00 | 2023-10-01 |
| 102 | Alicia Date | DELIVERED | â‚¬200.00 | COMPLETED | â‚¬200.00 | 2023-10-02 |
| 103 | Eric Dupont | SHIPPED | â‚¬300.00 | PENDING | â‚¬300.00 | 2023-10-03 |
| 104 | Alain Provist | CREATED | â‚¬300.00 | FAILED | â‚¬300.00 | 2023-10-04 |

## ðŸ”§ Files Updated

### 1. Payment Database (payment-app)
**File:** `payment-app/back/src/main/resources/data.sql`
- Updated order_id values to match business-app orders
- Updated customer names to match business-app customers  
- Updated payment amounts to match order amounts
- Updated payment dates to match order dates

### 2. Payment Frontend Fallback (payment-app)  
**File:** `payment-app/front/src/App.vue`
- Updated fallback payment data to match the database changes
- Ensures consistent data even when backend is unavailable

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration Benefits

1. **Consistent Customer Experience**: Same customer sees their order and payment data linked correctly
2. **Accurate Payment Status**: Order management UI now shows correct payment status for each order
3. **Data Integrity**: No orphaned payments or orders
4. **Testing Reliability**: Integration tests will work with consistent data across services

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Integration

When the Docker Compose stack is running:

1. **View Orders**: http://localhost:5173 
   - Each order will now display the correct payment status
   - John Doe's order (100) shows "COMPLETED" payment
   - Eric Dupont's order (103) shows "PENDING" payment
   - Alain Provist's order (104) shows "FAILED" payment

2. **View Payments**: http://localhost:5174
   - Payments correctly reference the order IDs from business-app
   - Customer names match between both applications

3. **API Integration**: Order backend calls payment backend at `/payments/order/{orderId}` and receives correct payment data

## ðŸ”„ Business Logic Flow

1. User places order â†’ Order created in business-app with status "CREATED"
2. Payment processed â†’ Payment record created in payment-app
3. User views orders â†’ Business-app fetches payment status from payment-app
4. Combined data displayed â†’ Order info + real-time payment status

This ensures both applications work together seamlessly with synchronized data!
