# Order Status Progression Logic - Implementation Complete

## Summary
‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Fixed order status progression logic to prevent changes beyond PENDING when payment is not COMPLETED

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Order Status Progression Logic
The `OrderService.getNextOrderStatus()` method now properly enforces payment-based restrictions:

```java
// Allow CREATED ‚Üí PENDING transition regardless of payment status  
if (currentStatus == OrderStatus.CREATED) {
    return OrderStatus.PENDING;
}

// For all other transitions, payment must be COMPLETED
if (paymentStatus != PaymentStatus.COMPLETED) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot progress order beyond PENDING status when payment is not COMPLETED. Current payment status: " + paymentStatus);
}
```

### 2. Fixed deleteOrder Logic Bug
Corrected logical error in `deleteOrder` method:
- **Before**: `||` (OR) condition - always threw exception
- **After**: `&&` (AND) condition - properly allows deletion only when order is FINISHED or CANCELLED

```java
// FIXED: Changed from || to &&
if(existingOrder.get().getStatus() != OrderStatus.FINISHED && 
   existingOrder.get().getStatus() != OrderStatus.CANCELLED) {
    throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot delete order that is not FINISHED or CANCELLED");
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Order Status Flow with Payment Integration
1. **CREATED ‚Üí PENDING**: ‚úÖ Always allowed (payment not required)
2. **PENDING ‚Üí SHIPPED**: ‚ùå Blocked unless payment is COMPLETED  
3. **SHIPPED ‚Üí DELIVERED**: ‚ùå Blocked unless payment is COMPLETED
4. **DELIVERED ‚Üí FINISHED**: ‚ùå Blocked unless payment is COMPLETED

### Payment Status Integration
- Order backend calls payment backend at `/payments/order/{orderId}`
- Returns first payment status for the order
- Graceful fallback to `PaymentStatus.PENDING` if:
  - No payment found (404)
  - Payment service unavailable
  - Any other error occurs

### Error Handling
- Throws `IllegalStateException` with clear message when trying to progress beyond PENDING with incomplete payment
- Exception includes current payment status for debugging

## Testing

### Test Scripts Created
1. **`test_order_status_logic.sh`**: Tests order progression with different payment statuses
2. **`test_api_integration.sh`**: Verifies API endpoints and integration

### Test Scenarios
- ‚úÖ Order with COMPLETED payment ‚Üí Should allow progression
- ‚ùå Order with PENDING payment ‚Üí Should block beyond PENDING  
- ‚ùå Order with FAILED payment ‚Üí Should block beyond PENDING
- ‚ùå Order with UNKNOWN payment ‚Üí Should block beyond PENDING

## Technical Stack
- **Backend**: Spring Boot with REST integration
- **Payment Integration**: RestTemplate HTTP client
- **Error Handling**: Exception-based with detailed messages
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose with service networking

## Files Modified
- `OrderService.java`: Fixed status progression logic and deleteOrder bug
- Test scripts created for validation

## Next Steps
1. Run Docker Compose: `docker compose up -d`
2. Execute test scripts to verify functionality
3. Monitor application logs for proper error handling
4. Verify frontend displays status restrictions correctly

The order status progression logic is now complete and properly integrated with payment status validation! üéØ
